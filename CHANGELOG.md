# Changelog

Release notes for tagged versions live in `docs/release-notes-*.md`.

## Unreleased

- Python 3.11 is the minimum (VMEX needs it); CI runs 3.13 with the latest JAX and checks 3.11 and 3.12.
- SOLVAX floor raised to 0.28.2; the factorization narrows its return type explicitly.
- VMEX and booz_xform_jax are optional extras (`ntx[vmex]`, `ntx[booz]`) installed from PyPI in CI.
- Committed artifacts and examples no longer carry machine-specific paths: producers write repo-relative paths or `checkout:relative` labels via `ntx._checkout_paths.portable_path`, and a test rejects home and temp paths in tracked files.
